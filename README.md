This system is intended to be used in a multi-dimension setting also known as a Lobby or a Multigamemode. It was made for DD though it also should work for SH and DM.
You could also run it in a normal race server if you set it up right.
You should run it alongside the killsystem if you want your kills to be saved(at least for DD) and displayed at the end of clanwar.
